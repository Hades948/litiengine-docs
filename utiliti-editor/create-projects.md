# Create Projects

Start the utiLITI editor. Hit “**File -&gt; New...**” \(Shortcut: **CTRL+N**\).

![utiliti-create-project](/getting-started/img/sdk-download_4.png)

In the file browser that pops up, navigate to your project directory and hit “**open**“.  
Even if you still have done nothing, hit **save** to create a _game resource file_.  
You can name your _game resource file_ whatever you want, we might refer to it as “game.litidata” later on.

You have now successfully created a new project! Let's have a look at the Layout of the utiLITI window and its basic functions.

# Window Layout

In the upper right corner, you can find the `Objects` and `Layers` tabs. In the `Objects` tab, you can find a hierarchy of all `MapObjects`. The `Layers` tab contains a list of all `Map Object Layers`, letting you modify layers in the following ways:
* ![Add](/images/utiliti-icons/add.png) Add
* ![Delete](/images/utiliti-icons/delete.png) Delete
* ![Copy](/images/utiliti-icons/copy.png) Copy
* ![Change Color](/images/utiliti-icons/color.png) Change Color
* ![Rename](/images/utiliti-icons/rename.png) Rename
* ![Show selected layer only](/images/utiliti-icons/hideother.png) Show selected layer only
* ![Send selected layer up](/images/utiliti-icons/lift.png) Send selected layer up
* ![Send selected layer down](/images/utiliti-icons/lower.png) Send selected layer down

In the bottom left corner, you can find the `Resources` and `Console` tabs. You can manage your game resources, such as .png file for creature and sound file. 

You can edit your `MapObjects` in the botton right corner. If you select an object, the properties of the object will appear. You can set up the objects' collision, dimensions, name, tags, etc. using these controls.
