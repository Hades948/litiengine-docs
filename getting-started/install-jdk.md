# Install JDK

## Installing the Java Development Kit 
First of all, you should download a Java development kit (**JDK**), containing the Java virtual machine (**JVM**) and other resources for developing Java applications.
Since LITIENGINE has been created with Java 8, you need at least JDK 8 on your machine.
> In case you are on linux or mac, you can also use [SKDMAN!](https://sdkman.io/) to manager your JDK installation. As soon you installed sdk man, type `sdk install java` in your terminal. The latest recommend JDK will be installed automatically for you. It should be registered in your IDE after you restart it. For further information look up the [SDKMAN! Docs](https://sdkman.io/usage).

> **The official Oracle JDK has seen some severe licensing changes in 2019, requiring a paid license for developing commercial applications!**
