# LITIENGINE Release notes

## v0.5.2-beta - "Java 17 Migration"

![LITIENGINE v0.5.1-beta featureimage](https://litiengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/litiengine-patch-banner-0.5.2.png)

Just in time for making your new year's resolution of creating amazing games with LITIENGINE, we proudly present our latest update, packed with 250 commits over the last ten months!

Let's talk about the elephant in the room: LITIENGINE is now fully running on Java 17! In the future, we plan to keep the library updated to the latest stable jdk versions for you to utilize all the juicy new features Java has to offer.

To make building ingame UI more pleasant, the `Slider`, `TextFieldComponent`, and `SpeechBubble` components have seen massive updates.

Bugfixes and UX improvements for utiLITI will ensure a more smooth experience when handling the editor.

Apart from that, a lot has changed in our build and deployment pipeline and the repository is now utilizing GitHub actions instead of Travis CI. This goes along with a completely revised directory structure and proper separation of submodules. The way we bundle native libraries has been adapted and the dependency on steamworks4j has been removed. Please also take note of our changed contribution guidelines: it is now required to comply with the Java code style conventions we provide in the repository (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/gurkenlabs/litiengine/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)).

Finally, a huge THANK YOU is in order: To all our new code contributors, to the community involved in discussing issues, to everyone providing help in our forum and on Discord, and lastly:
Thank you to our new Sponsors [RajBet](https://raj.bet/), [Trust My Paper](https://www.trustmypaper.com/), [CasinoHex Canada](https://onlinecasinohex.ca/), and [ej-technologies](https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html) (in chronological order of sponsorships)!

What are you waiting for? Start the new year the right way: making games with LITIENGINE.

## v0.5.1-beta - "No more Netcode"

![LITIENGINE v0.5.1-beta featureimage](https://litiengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/litiengine-changelog-featureimage-v0.5.1.png)

This release brings tons of bugfixes and quality-of-life improvements. Feature-wise, the highlight of this version is the addition of a [Tweening framework](https://github.com/gurkenlabs/litiengine/pull/352) that lets you interpolate values over time, e.g. to let your `GuiComponents` bounce or your `Entities` wiggle.
As the engine's networking code had been an unmaintained, untested, and even unsafe mess, we have decided to [remove the networking package entirely](https://github.com/gurkenlabs/litiengine/pull/368).

Our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/T8hVpun) has seen some upgrades and we gladly welcome our first community moderator, [Conifer](https://forum.litiengine.com/u/Conifer)! In order to give back some of your love, we have introduced some special roles for our forum and the Discord server:

* @Supporter : Members that have supported us with donations.
* @Contributor : Members that have contributed to our open source code repositories
* @Early Bird : Members that have been part of our community since the Alpha days of LITIENGINE.

We try to assign these roles to the best of our knowledge, but if we forgot you - please don't hesitate to complain. :)

Apart from that, we've updated the sponsoring tiers in [the LITIENGINE Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/litiengine), allowing you to support our work financially and with full transparency. We have also started a [spreadshirt shop](https://shop.spreadshirt.co.uk/gurkenlabs/) where you can buy all kinds of LITIENGINE related swag and promote the cause (feel free to suggest additional motives)!

As always, huge thanks to all contributors and fans! This is an exciting journey for us and we are grateful to share it with you.

## v0.5.0-beta - "Farewell, Alpha!" 
![LITIENGINE v0.5.0-beta featureimage](https://litiengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/litiengine-changelog-featureimage-v0.5.0.png)

This release marks the beginning of a new era for the LITIENGINE. We consider most of the API to be stable and we pretty much settled on the current API design.
With the release of our new Website, the documentation and other information about the engine are easier to use and everything can be found in one place.

It's been a long journey but, finally, we're leaving the Alpha status and are looking forward to even more fruitful experiences with the LITIENGINE in the future.
A big thank you to all members of this community. Without your feedback and contributions we wouldn't be here today. You're awesome!

##### Revamped the Emitter UI (make it actually usable)

With this version, we revamped the `Emitter` UI in the utiLITI editor such that changes to the emitter are instantly applied. The different parameters have been categorized and the overall usability has been drastically improved.
In addition, we've also added the possibility to configure particle rotation for even more vivid visual effects.
